# Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project focuses on **sales forecasting** using historical Walmart sales data. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling to forecast sales trends.

## Project Structure
- **Data/**
  - `Walmart.csv` → Dataset containing Walmart sales records.
- **src/**
  - `sales.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and forecasting models.
- **results/figures/**
  - Contains visualizations such as:
    - Actual vs Predicted Sales
    - Sales Trends by Month and Year
    - Weekly Sales Over Time
- **README.md** → Project documentation.

##  Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with sales trends.
- Visualization of seasonal and yearly sales patterns.
- Forecasting model to predict future sales.
- Comparison between actual vs predicted sales.

## Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`.)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or extract the ZIP.
2. Open `src/sales.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run all cells to generate forecasts and figures.
4. Results will be stored in the `results/figures/` folder.

## Results
- **Sales trend visualizations** (monthly, yearly, weekly).
- **Forecasting accuracy** demonstrated via Actual vs Predicted plots.
